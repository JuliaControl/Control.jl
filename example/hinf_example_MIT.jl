"""
This is a simple SISO example which was used for debugging the implementation,
as this exact example was use in the lecture notes of the "Principles of Optimal
Control" cours of the MIT OpenCourseWare [1], where the choice of weighting
functions and dynamics gave rise to an H-infinity optimal cotnroller with a
Î³ of approximately 1.36, where, in our case, we get a controller at 0.93

The example can be set to visualize and save plots using the two variables
  ShowPlots - true/false (true if plots are to be generated, false for testing)
  filename  - Set to string if files are to be saved, otherwise set a empty list
